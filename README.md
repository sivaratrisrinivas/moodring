# üîÆ moodring

A personal influence tracker to map and reflect on what shapes your thinking, decisions, and behavior over time.

## ‚ú® Core Idea

This application is designed to be a "memory mirror." It helps you track the books, articles, conversations, and videos that influence you, and then visualize the connections between them. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of your own intellectual and emotional journey by seeing how one idea leads to another.

## ‚úÖ Features Built (MVP)

We have successfully built a powerful Minimum Viable Product with the following features:

-   **Add Influence Entries:** A simple, frictionless way to add a new influence (a thought, a link, a quote) as a text entry.
-   **Link Influences:** The ability to create connections between any two entries, forming a "cause and effect" relationship.
-   **Chronological Timeline:** A clean, ordered list of all your entries, allowing you to see your journey over time.
-   **3D Influence Graph:** An interactive, 3D visualization of your influence network. You can switch to this view to see your ideas as a constellation of nodes and links that you can rotate, pan, and zoom.
-   **On-Demand AI Reflection:** A button that securely sends your influences from the last 7 days to the Google Gemini AI to generate a short, insightful summary of your week's themes and patterns.
