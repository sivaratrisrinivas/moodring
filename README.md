# üîÆ moodring

A personal influence tracker to map and reflect on the architecture of your own mind.

## The "Why" Behind moodring ü§î

We are constantly shaped by the information we consume‚Äîthe books we read, the videos we watch, the conversations we have. These influences quietly build our beliefs, habits, and worldview. Yet, this entire process is almost completely invisible and untracked.

**moodring is built to solve this.**

It‚Äôs a tool designed for **intellectual self-awareness**. It makes the invisible process of influence visible, allowing you to see the exact threads connecting an idea to an action, a piece of content to a new belief. By mapping your own intellectual journey, you can gain a deeper understanding of why you think the way you do.
